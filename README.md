# Text Sharpener

A project for text deblurring using deep learning.

We collected our datasets of textbook pictures from online resources, then manually created and applied blurry filters to them.

The model folder included the architects we explored and attempted, along with the best model we decided to use (UNetV2). The sample folder includes some examples of results and comparisons with different epoch values. Our data are trained and tested in the ipynb included in the repository after splitting into the train, validation, and test sets in dataset.py under the data folder.
